The purpose of this policy is to define the steps that must be taken to ensure that users connecting to <Company> resources are authenticated appropriately, in compliance with company standards, and are given the least amount of access required to perform their job function.\n\nScope\n\nThe scope of this policy includes all users who have access to company-owned or company-provided computers or require access to the corporate network and systems. This policy applies to employees and guests, contractors, and anyone needing access to the corporate systems.\n\nPolicy\n\nGeneral rules for Access Management\n\nAll <Company> information systems must be password protected.\n\nAll <Company> information systems must be MFA protected where possible.\n\nAll <Company> information systems must be accessible only through Corporate VPN when protection by MFA is impossible.\n\nAll <Company> information systems must have a designated information owner responsible for managing and controlling access to the system. \n\nAll <Company> information systems must have a designated system administrator. For some systems, it can be its owner as well.\n\nAccess to all <Company> information systems and networks must be strictly controlled by formal registration and deregistration processes.\n\nAccess to all <Company> information systems must be controlled by using unique user accounts. \n\nRegular access review process is performed to the critical systems only (<List of critical systems, Google Workspace etc.>).\n\nAccess to Network and Network Services\n\nOnly authorized personnel have access to the network services, where they will manage other necessary accesses, create, review, backup, and change network services configurations.\n\nUser Registration and Deregistration\n\nAll company employees must have their unique user account to serve as an identifier for their different systems, including the information that can identify them. \n\nUsage of an outdated user account is prohibited.\n\nUsage of one user account by different employees is unacceptable.\n\nSharing the credentials with another employee or person not working in <Company> is prohibited.\n\nSecurity Engineer creates new user accounts only after receiving the official requests.\n\nSecurity Engineer creates a new user or role using the user account as a name. \n\nWhen an employee leaves <Company>, all their information systems, network, and project-based accesses must be revoked as soon as possible. The access revoking is approved by the PM and done by a Security Engineer.\n\nUser Access Provisioning\n\nRequests from users for password resets must only be performed when the Security Engineer has verified the employee\u2019s identity.\n\nExisting users who require additional access privileges must make the official written request.\n\nAccesses for users who change their work responsibilities must be reviewed to ensure that the new role will not require those accesses. If the access is not needed, it will be revoked.\n\nManagement of Privileged Access Rights\n\nAccess rights and privileges to <Company> information systems must be allocated based on the user\u2019s functions.\n\nThe principles of zero-trust, least privilege, and need-to-know must be followed.\n\nAccess privileges granted to users must not undermine essential segregation of duties. \n\nThe creation of user access accounts with special privileges, such as administrators, must be controlled and restricted to only those responsible for managing or maintaining the information systems.\n\nReview of User Access Rights \n\nSystem administrators (owners) must conduct a quarterly review of the access rights for critical systems.\n\nWorkstation Lockout\n\n<Company> employees must lock their workstations in case of inactivity and re-enter the password.\n\nFor more information, refer to the <Company> Clear Desk and Clear Screen Policy.\n\n\n\nPassword Management\n\nThe employees are required to follow the rules for maintaining passwords securely.\n\nFor more information, refer to the <Company> Password Management Policy.\n\nDisciplinary actions\n\nEmployees who violate this policy may face disciplinary consequences in proportion to their violation. Management will determine how severe an employee\u2019s offense is and take the appropriate action.\n\nChange, Review, and Update\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed once every year unless the owner considers an earlier review necessary to ensure that the policy remains current. Changes to this policy shall be exclusively performed by the ISMS Manager and approved by the ISMS Committee. \n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}

Changes will be monitored and reviewed.  \n\nDefinitions\n\nAn \u201cIT change\u201d is a planned or unplanned action taken to build, design, modify, improve, fix, and re-configure network devices and systems.\n\nTwo types of change management requests are to be used: emergency and standard. An emergency change occurs when an immediate change to systems is necessary due to operational issues or critical security issues. A standard change occurs as a part of normal maintenance operations.\n\nThe Change request must be created only for changes that are conducted on or influence on <Company> Critical Assets listed in the <Company> Critical Asset Registry.\n\nThe \u201cChange request scope\u201d is each <Company> Critical information system component subject to change. This component must be defined in the <Company> Critical Asset Registry or must influence any system components in the <Company> Critical Asset Registry.\n\nThe \u201cImpact assessment\u201d is a process to analyze the impact of a proposed organizational change on the company processes.\n\nThe \u201cRoll-back plan\u201d is a plan that let's get back to the exact state that was in before the change implementation started.\n\n\n\nChange Process\n\nStandard Change Management Procedure\n\n<Company> what is scope change.\n\n", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}

Management will determine how severe an employee\u2019s offense is and take the appropriate action.\n\nChange, Review, and Update\n\nThis policy shall be reviewed once every year unless the owner considers an earlier review necessary to ensure that the policy remains current. Changes to this policy shall be exclusively performed by the ISMS Manager and approved by the ISMS Committee. \n\nResponsibility\n\nThis is the responsibility of the ISMS Manager to maintain and make sure everyone is aware of this policy.\n\nReference\n\nISO 27001 A.10.1.1 Policy on the Use of Cryptographic Controls\n\nISO 27001 A.10.1.2 Key Management\n\nRelated Documents\n\n\n\n<Company> Encryption Policy\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                  4\n\nThis document is for internal use only", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": null, "end_char_idx": null, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n", "class_name": "TextNode"}

Typically, a patch is installed into an existing software program. Patches are often temporary fixes between full releases of a software package. Patches include, but are not limited to the following:\n\nUpdating software;\n\nFixing a software bug;\n\nInstalling new drivers;\n\nAddressing new security vulnerabilities;\n\nAddressing software stability issues.\n\nLaptops\n\nEvery employee\u2019s responsibility is to monitor notifications about new updates available for their OS and install them on their laptops. \n\nAutomated updates should be enabled on each employee\u2019s laptop.\n\nServers\n\nThe Patch management is established based on the vulnerability management process (described within <Company> Vulnerability Management Policy). After conducting the vulnerability-defining process (Vulnerability scanning and Penetration testing) the asset owners must be notified about current vulnerabilities on their assets.\n\nAsset owners are responsible for timely patching every vulnerability according to instructions from the performer of the vulnerability scanning or penetration testing. \n\nAny upgrade must be tested before deployment if it is related to critical assets or if it can influence any of the critical assets.\n\nThe suggested action items for Patch Management are:\n\nKeep the inventory of the critical systems, including the operating systems and software versions, physical location, IP addresses, etc up to date. \n\nAssess the vulnerability and risk and classify the risk accordingly. Find servers and systems which are vulnerable and company-critical.\n\nEvaluate all missing software updates according to the risk they pose.
